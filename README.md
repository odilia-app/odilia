## Welcome to Odilia

Odilia is a screen reader for the Linux desktop.
It's written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), for maximum performance and stability.

## Status: Beta

This is **absolutely not production ready in any way!**  
Everything is in a fairly early stage and we're changing things on a daily basis.
However, Odilia is _somewhat_ useable, and will not crash randomly or cause weird behaviour in other applications.  
Try it out! See if it works for you!

## Prerequisites

The MSRV for Odilia is `1.65`.

You will need to have `speech-dispatcher` installed and running before you can start Odilia.
To test that speech dispatcher is indeed working properly, try running this command:

```shell
spd-say "hello, world!"
```

if you heard a voice saying "hello, world!", you can proceed to installing.
Otherwise, check if sound is working on the computer in general.

## Build and install

To build odilia, copy paste the following on your command line . The following snippet will clone, build and install it for you, all at once without user interaction. The final binaries will be located in `~/.cargo/bin`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/odilia-app/odilia  && \
cd odilia && \
cargo build --release && \
cargo install --path odilia
```

## Running

Simply type `odilia` in your terminal!
